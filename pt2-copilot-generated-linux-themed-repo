That’s a killer combo — Linux, cyber analysis, and pentesting? You’re cooking with fire 🔥. Here are some **high-impact additions** you could make to your repo to showcase your skills and help others in the field:

### 🛠️ Tools & Scripts
- **Custom Bash scripts** for log parsing, privilege escalation checks, or automated recon
- **Python tools** for scanning, enumeration, or brute-forcing (e.g., SSH, FTP, web forms)
- **Payload generators** (reverse shells, obfuscated scripts, etc.)
- **System hardening scripts** for Linux servers (auditd, iptables, AppArmor configs)

### 🧪 Lab Environments
- **Dockerized vulnerable apps** (like DVWA, Juice Shop, or custom CTF challenges)
- **Ansible playbooks** to deploy pentest labs or forensic environments
- **VM setup guides** for Kali, Parrot, BlackArch, etc., with your preferred toolsets

### 📚 Knowledge Base
- **Cheat sheets** for Linux commands, enumeration, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation
- **Write-ups** of real-world pentests or CTFs you’ve done (redacted if needed)
- **Threat modeling templates** or incident response workflows

### 🔍 Recon & OSINT
- **Automated OSINT tools** using APIs (Shodan, HaveIBeenPwned, etc.)
- **Domain and subdomain enumeration scripts**
- **Metadata scrapers** for images, PDFs, and documents

### 🧬 Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis
- **Static/dynamic analysis tools** for Linux binaries
- **YARA rules** or custom signatures for malware detection
- **Sandbox setup guides** for safe malware testing

### 🧰 Red Team Arsenal
- **Custom C2 frameworks or implants**
- **Obfuscation and AV evasion techniques**
- **Linux persistence mechanisms** (cron jobs, systemd services, etc.)

If you want to go full beast mode, check out the [100 Red Team Projects list](https://github.com/kurogai/100-redteam-projects) — it’s a goldmine of ideas from basic to advanced. Want help building one of these out? I’d love to collaborate.
