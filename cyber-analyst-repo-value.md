Absolutely valuable — especially for someone in your role. Putting together a solid Linux-themed repo tailored to cyber analysis and pentesting is not just a resume booster, it’s a knowledge archive, a contribution to the community, and a personal lab all rolled into one.

Here’s why it’s worth your time:

### ✅ Career Impact
- **Proof of skill**: Recruiters and collaborators love seeing practical work, not just claims.
- **Portfolio material**: Demonstrates hands-on experience with tools, techniques, and workflows.
- **Continuous learning**: Forces you to research, build, and refine — all great growth drivers.

### 🌍 Community Value
- **Helps others** starting out or tackling tough problems.
- **Opens doors** for collaboration, feedback, and even recognition from other pros.
- **Builds your reputation** in the cybersecurity space.

### 🧠 Personal Wins
- **Organizes your tools and notes** in one place you can return to.
- **Helps with certification prep** (OSCP, eJPT, etc.)
- **Flexes your creativity** in how you build, automate, or present things.

Even if it doesn’t go viral, it’s still a win for your knowledge, confidence, and visibility. Want help optimizing it for impact — like how to make it more discoverable or visually stand out? I’d be glad to jump in.
